    <h1>January 2022</h1>
    <p>Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. (<a href="/2021-review-2022-goals">details</a>)</p>
<p>These will be marked as completed or fail as the month progresses and a summary written at the beginning of
the next month.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong class="green-background">Run 5km</strong> - I used to run a lot and loved it. Then I stopped after a leg injury. I peaked with a 5km time of just over 20 minutes. Getting to 5km is the first easy goal followed by a sub 30 minute time.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Finish flat</strong> - We bought this flat over a year ago and there are still a few lingering things that need finishing. I need to stop procrastinating and get it done...or at least pay somebody else to get it done.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Carve a spoon</strong> - I went on a <a href="https://barnthespoon.com/">spoon carving course</a> a few years ago, loved it and then never thought about it again. A goal this year is to rekindle a passion for traditional crafts and processes - starting with carving a wooden spoon.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Write at least two essays</strong> - I have a folder of ideas and half finished writing going back over six years. Time to see some through to the end.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Finish Epic React</strong> - Do I need to? Probably not. But the course by <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/">Kent C. Dodds</a> undoubtedly had lots of gems and will shine a light onto the many blindspots I have developed during my career.</li>
</ul>
