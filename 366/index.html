<h1>366</h1>
<a class="port-link" href="https://366-quotes.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" `>Deployed</a>
<p>A full-stack app generating daily quotes to inspire, intrigue or contemplate. Built with HTML,
CSS, Javascript and Firebase to replace a previous NodeJS/PostgreSQL backend.
<img src="/assets/images/366.webp" alt="366 app screenshot" title="366"></p>
<p>366 was the product of wanting to learn about optimising API requests, data caching and a very old
set of 'quote' cards I owned as a child. The cards each had a date on one side and an interesting quote,
proverb or fact on the other; the reader was encouraged to only look at one per day and to reflect,
ponder and disaect the content. I always flicked through until I found one I liked or that felt pertinent at
the time which was, of course, completely beside the point.</p>
<p>I originally built a NodeJS server with a PostgreSQL database that contained 366 quotes each assigned to
a specific day of the year. The simple, responsive front-end would make an API call based on the date and retrieve
the quote and cache it locally, never making another request until the date changed.</p>
<p>The process worked well and was fast and efficient. I moved over to a Firebase storage and serverless
implementation simply as a way to refactor the code and learn about a new technology. Users can easily share the quote of
the day to Twitter or set it as their homepage to have an interesting prompt to start the morning.</p>
