description: A reflection on May and a plan for June
---

Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](../202 1-review-2022-goals))

Progress from [May](./may) - A rough one. Unfocused due to a big career move, other life stuff etc. No excuse. Back on the path.

- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Start Naval's 60 Minute 60 Day Meditation Practice</strong> - Zero days.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">15 hours on the Peloton</strong> - Zero hours.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Research and buy new camera</strong> - Opted for the Fujifilm X100T. Have used it a fair bit already and it lives up to the hype.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Read 4 books (that I've been procrastinating on reading)</strong> - Read a fair bit of each but nowhere near finishing any. Didn't realise Athlas Shrugged was 1000+ page; have put a significant dent in it.
