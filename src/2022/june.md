description: A reflection on May and a plan for June
---

Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](/2021-review-2022-goals))

Progress from [May](/2022/may) - A rough one. Unfocused due to a big career move, other life stuff etc. No excuses. Back on the path.

- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Start Naval's 60 Minute 60 Day Meditation Practice</strong> - Zero days.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">15 hours on the Peloton</strong> - Zero hours.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Research and buy new camera</strong> - Opted for the Fujifilm X100T. Have used it a fair bit already and it lives up to the hype.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Read 4 books (that I've been procrastinating on reading)</strong> - Read a little of each but nowhere near finishing any. Didn't realise Atlas Shrugged was 1000+ pages.

New goals for June 2022.

- <strong class="green-background">Set up website/area for photography</strong> - Here? A separate site? An Instagram account?
- <strong class="green-background">15 hours on the Peloton</strong> - We go again. I hate failing.
- <strong class="green-background">Great first month at Tipalti</strong> - First month at my new job; let's make it outstanding.
- <strong class="green-background">Origami</strong> - I used to make complicated origamis as a way to relax - haven't done it in years and after rewatching [Blade Runner 2049](https://youtu.be/9DU1moRloYE)
  I feel the urge again.
