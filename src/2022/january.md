Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](/2021-review-2022-goals))

These will be marked as completed or fail as the month progresses and a summary written at the beginning of
the next month.

- <strong class="green-background">Run 5km</strong> - I used to run a lot and loved it. Then I stopped after a leg injury. I peaked with a 5km time of just over 20 minutes. Getting to 5km is the first easy goal followed by a sub 30 minute time.
- <strong class="green-background">Finish flat</strong> - We bought this flat over a year ago and there are still a few lingering things that need finishing. I need to stop procrastinating and get it done...or at least pay somebody else to get it done.
- <strong class="green-background">Carve a spoon</strong> - I went on a [spoon carving course](https://barnthespoon.com/) a few years ago, loved it and then never thought about it again. A goal this year is to rekindle a passion for traditional crafts and processes - starting with carving a wooden spoon.
- <strong class="green-background">Write at least two essays</strong> - I have a folder of ideas and half finished writing going back over six years. Time to see some through to the end.
- <strong class="green-background">Finish Epic React</strong> - Do I need to? Probably not. But the course by [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) undoubtedly had lots of gems and will shine a light onto the many blindspots I have developed during my career.
