description: A reflection on (the end of) October and a plan for November
---

Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](/2021-review-2022-goals))

---

Progress from [October](/2022/october) - Good month. Rode a tough wave out from September which led to a very successful second half of the month both personally and professionally.

- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Write new post</strong> - Read it [here](/startup-v-bigtech)
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Make book list</strong> - Made a list [here](/books). Will be updated weekly.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Decorate office</strong> - New prints framed and mounted, painting touched up, gym area refined.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Get to MVP of Upstand</strong> - Didn't get anywhere with it. Potentially going to start [Founder University](https://www.founder.university/) so will reevaluate.

New goals for November 2022.

- <strong class="green-background">Three day fast</strong> - I did one back in [February](/2022/february) and it was a joyous physical and mental test.
- <strong class="green-background">Book Vipassana retreat</strong> - I saw this great [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkxSyv5R1sg) years ago about the incredible benefits of Vipassana when it was introduced to a prison in India. 10 days of 8+ hours of meditation every day. No books, no writing, no talking.
- <strong class="green-background">Aim for 1000 Twitter followers</strong> - Totally arbitrary. But I like random goals. [Follow me](https://twitter.com/MrRoryFlint)
- <strong class="green-background">10 hours of Peloton training</strong> - Have tried and failed at fitness goals all year. May as well go again.
