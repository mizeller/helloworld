description: A reflection on February and a plan for March
---

Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](/2021-review-2022-goals))

Progress from [February](/2022/february) - I had a great month. I turned 31 - some wins, some losses. Some strikes, some gutters. Lots learnt, lots to learn.

- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Run 5km</strong> - Two months in a row. Have been on the Peloton a lot but haven't laced up my running shoes once.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Finish Epic React</strong> - Tick. Lots learnt. Naturally I immediately get a new job that will primarily be writing C# rather than JavaScript/React. More on that another time.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">3 Day Fast</strong> - A little late, it bled into March...but done. I haven't fasted for a long time and it was tough but well worth it. Physically tiring but the mental clarity was blissful.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">No Complaining</strong> - A good start to the month - the first 10 or so days were noticeably improved and then I fell of the wagon. Have got the [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complaint-Free-World-21-day-challenge/dp/0753513463) now and will be continuing.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Finish/Update Portfolio</strong> - Done. Tidied. Lots more to do but all the issues I had previously noticed were resolved.
