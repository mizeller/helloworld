description: A reflection on June and July and a plan for August
---

Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](/2021-review-2022-goals))

---

Progress from [June](/2022/june) - No update from June or July, life has been a little crazy with the new job, some traveling, some ups and some downs. It's now the 22nd August; over 80 days since the last
update. There are only 10 days left in the month so the goals set are minimal but I fully intend to get back on the goal setting in September.

- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Set up website/area for photography</strong> - Nope.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">15 hours on the Peloton</strong> - Nope.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Great first month at Tipalti</strong> - Coming up on 3 months now and enjoying it throughly. Lots learnt, lots to learn.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Origami</strong> - Not lots, but some. Very relaxing and meditative.

New goals for August 2022.

- <strong class="green-background">Set up website/area for photography</strong> - Round 2. Have a new camera and plenty to post.
- <strong class="green-background">Knife sharpening</strong> - I've not carved anything for a while, in part because I need to sharpen my knives which I don't know how to do.
- <strong class="green-background">Finish flat improvements (reframing, remounting)</strong> - We were going to move to a new place this year but given the insane financial markets have decided to stay put and weather the storm. There are a few home improvements I've been procrastinating on that need to be finished.
