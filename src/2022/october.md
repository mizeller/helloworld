Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](/2021-review-2022-goals))

Progress from [September](/2022/september) - In the words of The Dude: [strikes and gutters](https://youtu.be/sYsw0KVRjCM). Finishing on a high.

- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Carve spoons</strong> - Three started, one finished (my favourite one yet). Lots learnt along the way about using chisels, sharpening and a few new cutting techniques.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Bake more bread</strong> - A single wonderful white loaf. It was delicious and fed us for a long weekend.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Functional Programming</strong> - It is hard. Really hard. But I've studied for many, many hours and feel like I am beginning to see daylight.
- ❌ <strong class="green-background">Do nothing</strong> - An overcomplicated and busy internal and external month.

New goals for October 2022.

- <strong class="green-background">Write new post</strong> - I've been making notes on working as a software engineer at a small, scrappy start-up vs a large, established corporate finance company. It might be interesting. It might not be.
- <strong class="green-background">Make book list</strong> - I saw a great site on Hacker News where the author listed all of their reads in order with minor commentary/review. Not dissimilar to [this](https://sive.rs/book) by Derek Sivers. I read a lot and then forget what I've read. I'm going to develop some sort of pragmatic solution and keep track publicly.
- <strong class="green-background">Decorate office</strong> - It's not _undecorated_ but it could do with some artwork, a few licks of paint and some general love. 50% of my work week is spent in here so it should be beautiful.
- <strong class="green-background">Get to MVP of Upstand</strong> - I've been loosely working on a side project, Upstand, for a couple of weeks and want to get to MVP. Will need to _write_ an MVP first...
