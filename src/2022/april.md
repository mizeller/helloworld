Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. ([details](/2021-review-2022-goals))

---

Progress from [March](/2022/march) - Great month. Best of the year so far.

- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Eat at Michelin Star Restaurant</strong> - We went to [Leroy](https://www.leroyshoreditch.com/) in Shoreditch. Fantastic food. Well worth the trip.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Finish Three Half Finished Books</strong> - All done. The James Smith book was solid, Mental Models Vol. 1 was brilliant(I've bought the second two volumes) and The Book of EST was bizarre but excellent. Continued by finishing two others before the end of the month.
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Start Goggins Project</strong> - Started and finished. Published Goggins Blocker Chrome Extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goggins-blocker/kpnafocdjkofgnpaafppplaghogpgadk).
- ✅ <strong class="green-background">Write Career Post/Thoughts</strong> - Wrote it and got some excellent feedback and responses. Find it [here](https://rory.codes/thoughts-on-career.html).

New goals for April 2022.

- <strong class="green-background">Fix Posture</strong> - I've always had bad posture which has been exacerbated by a career in front of a desk. Resources I'm using include [Overcoming Poor Posture](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Overcoming-Poor-Posture-Systematic-Performance/dp/194755400X) and [r/posture](https://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/top/?sort=top&t=all)
- <strong class="green-background">Start Naval's 60 Minute 60 Day Meditation Practice</strong> - Naval's original [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856) explains the concept and his thinking. 60 minutes of meditation for 60 days to reset the mind. Interesting write ups and discussion [here](https://sameerbajaj.com/OneHourMeditation/), [here](https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/meditation-mental-strength), [here](https://www.deepanseeralan.com/random/my-thoughts-on-completing-naval's-60-day-meditation/) and [here](https://www.thenow.co/naval-ravikant-meditation/).
- <strong class="green-background">No News</strong> - I won't lie, I'm addicted. I know the latest troop movements in Ukraine. I know who attended Prince Phillip's memorial service. It's a waste of energy and never has a positive impact on my life. I read [The News: A User's Manual](https://www.alaindebotton.com/news-users-manual/) by Alain de Botton a few years ago and he makes fantastic and poignant points. A good video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I08u0eKvwUY).
- <strong class="green-background">Invest</strong> - My new job has given me a significant set of stock options. It has inspired me to understand the market with some conviction and start dipping my toe into the investment waters. All recommendations and advice appreciated!
