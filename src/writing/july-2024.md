I dislike excuses. This isn’t one.

In the midst of early parenthood, career development and other [major life changes](/becoming-a-father-after-losing-one) I have let too much slip. In the iconic words of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) in Taxi Driver:

> I gotta get in shape now. Too much sitting has ruined my body. Too much abuse has gone on for too long. From now on it’ll be 50 push ups each morning. 50 pull ups. No more pills. No more bad food. No more destroyers of my body. From now on it’ll be total organisation; every muscle must be tight.

For July 2024, the following will be true:

- No sugar, no bad food.
- No fizzy drinks
- No alcohol
- No mindless doomscrolling
- No days without physical exercise

I will keep myself accountable. [Here](/july-2024-review) is the blog post reviewing progress - it will be empty initially but will serve as either a sore reminder of my failure or an account of my success.
