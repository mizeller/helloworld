I am holding myself accounting throughout July. You can read how and why [here](/july-2024).

~~If you are reading this, either July has not yet finished or I failed miserably.~~

### Update

A success. _Mostly_.

- No sugar, no bad food ✅
- No fizzy drinks ✅
- No alcohol ❌
- No mindless doomscrolling ❌
- No days without physical exercise ✅

I haven't had any sugar or sweetener in a month. I'm about 9lbs/4kg down which was never the goal but a welcome side-effect. I do not feel beholden to sweetness post-meal or for an afternoon pick me up; something that has cursed me for many years.

I abstained from drinking alcohol for 29 days of the 31 but had a single drink at two separate parties. Such is life.

Doom-scrolling is much improved, 98% of the way there. But it would be false to say I did not mindlessly doomscroll in July.

### What's next?

More. Double down. Five months left in 2024 to make it the best year ever.
