At the end of 2021 I decided to abandon the traditional New Year’s Resolutions in favour of a month by month approach. I kept in mind four themes that I had hoped would be threads that ran through the year but each month was nonetheless kept distinct.

## How Did it Go?

From a simple data perspective, it went as follows:

- I set goals 10 out of 12 months
- I set 41 individual goals
- 21 were successful (52%)

So, not great. I’ve been pondering the successes and failures over the past few days and, whilst far from definitive, have concluded that I lost sight of the over-arching themes and descended into making a high level to-do list rather than actionable and important goals.

That’s not to say it was all a failure. The monthly accountability was excellent at getting things done that I probably would’ve have otherwise. Things like ‘Eat at a Michelin star restaurant’, which I ended up doing five times; five times more than I would have otherwise, or 'Research and buy new camera’. These are things I’ve wanted to do but quickly forget about or de-prioritise. The monthly review and goal setting was a great way of keeping my ADHD riddled brain on track and getting things done.

It is, however, apparent, that the system fails when things are hard. Any goal that would be of significant effort, particularly physical, fairly quickly failed. I tried multiple times to get back into running, to hit Peloton targets and develop a sustained meditation practice. These things that I didn’t **really** want were easily dismissed as failed goals.

## Themes

The four themes I hoped to focus on were Physical Fitness, Mental Fitness/Health, Leaning and Career.

My physical fitness and health are significantly worse now than at the start of the year. Mental fitness/health is probably fairly unchanged. Ups and downs, strikes and gutters. Learning, similarly, has been up and down. Lots of big moments of progress and then laziness and lack of discipline.

Career is the standout. I moved to a new company in June and have significantly increased financial freedom, future opportunities and general work satisfaction. The only fault I can find this year regarding career is that the desire and energy to progress was somewhat tamed by a big improvement. I hate resting on my laurels.

## 2023 and Beyond

I had an epiphany recently that I am sure many, many other people in the world have already had.

Physical fitness and health are everything.

Everything. Every goal, every idea and every thing I do and want to achieve is either drastically heightened by excellent health or prevented by poor fitness. Everything.

So that’s it. I will keep the monthly system to keep myself accountable and achieving various things but there are no themes beyond physical fitness and health. I have faith that, with a little coercion, everything else will begin to fall into line.

I wish you every success for the coming 12 months. Happy New Year!
