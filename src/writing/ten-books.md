Whether you're starting a business, launching a product, trying to get rich, getting fit, wanting to self-improve, developing a side hustle or just merely existing, there are some books that are recommended at every turn. Books that 'everyone must read', essential' and 'life-changing'.

They have become so commonplace in recommendations that I have developed a sort of learned blindness; whenever I read such a list or somebody recommends books to me I gloss over and ignore those I am most aware of.

The question I am interested in: _are they actually any good?_ I have a suspicion that a lot of the authors of the aforementioned lists may not have fully digested or read the books themselves or even rate them highly. There is a group think that occurs when you are told something is excellent: when you go to list things you think are brilliant you are inclined to mention the items you know to be considered high quality as to validate your other choices.

Or, perhaps, they really are as good as they are supposed to be. Below are ten books that are consistently recommended that I _haven't_ read. These will be my next ten reads come hell or high water. The titles will, in time, become links to a short summary and review and eventually I'll consider the question again.

<br />

- **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People** by Stephen R. Covey
- **How to Win Friends and Influence People** by Dale Carnegie
- **Zero to One** by Peter Thiel
- **The 4-Hour Work Week** by Tim Ferriss
- **The 48 Laws of Power** by Robert Greene
- **Shoe Dog** by Phil Knight
- **Awaken the Giant Within** by Anthony Robbins
- **War of Art** by Steven Pressfield
- **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** by Richard Feynman
- **Black Swan** by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

<br />That's quite a list. I wonder if I develop 7 Habits and learn 48 Laws in 4 hour weeks I'll Awaken the Giant? Time will tell.
