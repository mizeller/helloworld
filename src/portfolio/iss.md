ISS Tracker uses HTML, CSS and Javascript along with the Google Maps API and an ISS Location
API to visually display exactly where the International Space Station is at any time.

After being inspired by a similar project displaying incredible information about the International
Space Station, I took the oppurtunity to learn about interacting with the Google Maps API and show
a visual track of the current ISS location.

I stripped back all extrenuous information to give as clear as possible representation of the location,
speed and trajectory.
