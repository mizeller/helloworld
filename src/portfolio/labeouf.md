LaBeouf Blocker is a Chrome extension that allows you to block unproductive or undesirable websites
and receive motivation from Shia LeBeouf's famous 'Just Do It' video in the process.

LaBeouf Blocker was created as a project to learn about coding a Chrome extension whilst also building
a simple product that would help stop the constant distractions that interrupted the development process.

I wanted a simple way to be able to quickly block and unblock websites that were counter-productive
to whatever I was currently learning or working on, whilst also not not needing
to sign in or have my data stolen/sold. It seemed a perfect place to throw in some motivation from the famous Shia LaBeouf ['Just Do It'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)
video.

Once installed, users are able to block a website directly whilst browsing using the extension shortcut or
can manually add or remove them from their own LaBeouf Blocker dashboard. All data is stored locally on
Chrome and requires no login nor is any data sent or received by first or third parties.
