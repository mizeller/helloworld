A Day by Day visualisation of life. A memento mori of sorts.

Day by Day was built in a few hours in an attempt to visualise and come to terms with the finite nature of life.
Originally inspired by Buster Benson and Tim Urban, I took their weekly visualisations and went a step further and
broke it down into days.

This project reached the front page of Hacker News on launch.
