Ceriph is an application that allows encryption and decryption of messages using a simple substitution cipher.
Built with React and styled-components.

After a visit to the fantastic [Bletchley Park](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/) I was inspired to read up and
learn about ciphers and code breaking. As I was learning I built a simple app to encrypt and decrypt messages using a substitution
cipher. It uses one of the most simple ciphers possible but it was a great joy to take a process I was reading about
and implement it dynamically in Javascript.

Continued development is in process and as I learn more about more sophisticated encryption methodology I am planning
to add a variety of ciphers to choose from and additional information to learn more about the history of each.
