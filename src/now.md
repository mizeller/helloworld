## Working From Home

Currently still, like most people, working from home due to the pandemic. I miss the human interaction of an office and the ability to bounce ideas off each other easily but I do not miss the commute. Swings and roundabouts. I wonder if, in tech at at least, full time offices will ever return?

## Learning

Currently continuing to try and stay on the [exponentia](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) learning curve and working on the following things in the little spare time I have:

- [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) (machine learning, data science etc)
- [Crypto](https://nakamoto.com/) - I have a good knowledge but it is changing rapidly. Currently also programming in Solidity to get to grips with Ethereum.

## Other

Living in London; recently bought an apartment and we are slowly making it perfect. We will probably move in a year or so to a house to allow for a _bigger_ future.

Working on lots of little projects - trying to improve my personal time management as to allow for all the things I want to be complete whilst also not imploding. A delicate operation.
