Hello! My name is Rory, I'm a software engineer from London, England. I studied Full Stack Web Development at
<a href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> after several years working as a commercial
photographer.

Beyond work I read voraciously, build plenty of side projects and try to live a full life away from all things digital.

Here's what I'm doing [now](/now/).
