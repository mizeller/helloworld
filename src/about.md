Hello! My name is Rory, I'm a software engineer from London, England. I studied Full Stack Web Development at
<a href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> after several years working as a commercial
photographer.

I primarily code in Javascript; React on the front-end and NodeJS for the back-end, but I have recently been
working with Python on several data science and machine learning projects.

Beyond work I read voraciously, keep a close eye on all things
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">bitcoin</a> and try to live a full life.

Here's what I'm doing [now](/now/).
